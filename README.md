OldPaint
========

Oldskool drawing program in a browser. Somewhat inspired by programs like Deluxe Paint (good ol' DPaint) but tries to add some more modern features such as layers and multiple undo. It supports (in principle, at least) loading and saving PNG and OpenRaster files.

Draw with the left mousebutton, erase with the right and pan/zoom the image with the mousewheel. Some functionality is only reachable through the keyboard, such as undo (z) and redo (y).

Note: this is not a "webapp"; everything happens locally in your browser and you load/save files from your harddive. It does not require network access.

Currently should work in Chrome 22, and partially in FF 15. It is very much a work in progress, so don't use it for anything.
